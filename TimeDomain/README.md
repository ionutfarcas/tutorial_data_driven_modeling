# Part 1: Learning from Time-domain State Space Data

This folder contains code examples for the first half of the minitutorial.

- [**CompressibleEuler1D**](./CompressibleEuler1D/): A small model problem defined on a one-dimensional spatial domain.
- [**VortexShedding2D**](./VortexShedding2D/): A mid-sized problem defined on a two-dimensional spatial domain.

A 3D example with data from a rotating detonation engine and distributed routines can be found at [github.com/ionutfarcas/distributed_Operator_Inference](https://github.com/ionutfarcas/distributed_Operator_Inference)
