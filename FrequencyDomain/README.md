# Part 2: Learning from Frequency-domain Data

This folder contains code examples for the second half of the minitutorial.

- [**MassSpringDamper**](./MassSpringDamper/): An scalable introductory example to modeling with the Loewner framework.
- [**ThermalDiffusion**](./ThermalDiffusion/): A PDE example for creating reduced-order models without spatial discretizations.
- [**PorousBone**](./PorousBone): An example with given frequency domain data, approached with the AAA algorithm.
